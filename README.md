# Unbabel - Bakckend Engineering Challenge




Simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're interested in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes
  
  If you want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes you would call unbabel application like .

	unbabel --input_file events.json --window_size 10

# Bakckend Engineering Challenge


Welcome to our Engineering Challenge repository 🖖

If you found this repository it probably means that you are participating in our recruitment process. Thank you for your time and energy. If that's not the case please take a look at our [openings](https://unbabel.com/careers/) and apply!

Please fork this repo before you start working on the challenge, read it careful and take your time and think about the solution. Also, please fork this repository because we will evaluate the code on the fork.

This is an opportunity for us both to work together and get to know each other in a more technical way. If have some doubt please open and issue and we'll reach out to help.

Good luck!

## Challenge Scenario

At Unbabel we deal with a lot of translation data. One of the metrics we use for our clients' SLAs is the delivery time of a translation. 

In the context of this problem, and to keep things simple, our translation flow is going to be modeled as only one event.

### *translation_delivered*

Example:

```json
{
	"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:12:19.903159",
	"translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4",
	"source_language": "en",
	"target_language": "fr",
	"client_name": "easyjet",
	"event_name": "translation_delivered",
	"duration": 20,
	"nr_words": 100
}
```

## Challenge Objective

Your mission is to build a simple command line application that parses a stream of events and produces an aggregated output. In this case, we're interested in calculating, for every minute, a moving average of the translation delivery time for the last X minutes.

If we want to count, for each minute, the moving average delivery time of all translations for the past 10 minutes we would call your application like (feel free to name it anything you like!).

	unbabel_cli --input_file events.json --window_size 10

The input file format would be something like:

	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:11:08.509654","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa5","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 20}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:15:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75aa4","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "easyjet","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 30, "duration": 31}
	{"timestamp": "2018-12-26 18:23:19.903159","translation_id": "5aa5b2f39f7254a75bb33","source_language": "en","target_language": "fr","client_name": "booking","event_name": "translation_delivered","nr_words": 100, "duration": 54}


The output file would be something in the following format.

```
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:11:00", "average_delivery_time": 0}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:12:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:13:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:14:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:15:00", "average_delivery_time": 20}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:16:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:17:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:18:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:19:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:20:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:21:00", "average_delivery_time": 25.5}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:22:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:23:00", "average_delivery_time": 31}
{"date": "2018-12-26 18:24:00", "average_delivery_time": 42.5}
```

# New Features!

  - If the user inserted a path to a file that does not exist or is not in the correct format, the application will ask the user for a new path
